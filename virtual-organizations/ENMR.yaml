AppDescription: "The most CPU intensive application is CS-ROSETTA, that allows structure\
  \ determination of proteins based on chemical shift \ninformation alone. It thus\
  \ bypasses the need for NOE based distance restraints, which usually require \n\
  considerable time to obtain. Further advantages of using chemical shifts are that\
  \ these are among the \nmost reliable parameters that can be obtained from NMR spectroscopy\
  \ and that they can potentially be \nobtained for larger macromolecules for which\
  \ NOEs become impractical. On the other hand, direct \nchemical shift based structure\
  \ determination is computationally much more expensive than structure \ncalculations\
  \ using distance restraints.  However, the most time consuming part of a CS-ROSETTA\
  \ run \nconsists of a large number of independent calculations that can be easily\
  \ distributed over the GRID."
