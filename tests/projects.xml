Standard binding free energies are frequently sought in drug design. According to implicit ligand theory, standard binding free energies can be determined from binding potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from different receptor structures. Binding PMFs are a special type of binding free energy in which the receptor is rigid. The purpose of this project is to develop methods for estimating binding PMFs.</Description><PIName>David Minh</PIName><Organization>Illinois Institute of Technology</Organization><Department>Chemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Chemistry</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>374</ID><Name>all</Name><Description>The South Pole Telescope (or SPT) is a new telescope deployed at the South Pole that is designed to study the Cosmic Microwave background. Constructed between November 2006 and February 2007, the SPT is the largest telescope ever deployed at the South Pole. This telescope provides astronomers a powerful new tool to explore dark energy, the mysterious phenomena that may be causing the universe to accelerate.  SPT members from various institutions are all added into this group. This group utilize the OSG opportunistic cycles.</Description><PIName>John Carlstrom</PIName><Organization>University of Chicago</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>Astrophysics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>19</ID><Name>SPT Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>55</ID><Name>AMFORA</Name><Description>Amfora is a POSIX-compatible parallel scripting framework that lets users run existing programs in parallel with data stored in RAM on distributed platforms: e.g. clouds, clusters, supercomputers.</Description><PIName>Ian Foster</PIName><Organization>University of Chicago</Organization><Department>Computer Science</Department><FieldOfScience>Computer and Information Science and Engineering</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>309</ID><Name>AmorphousOrder</Name><Description>Glass-forming liquids exhibit dramatical slowdown upon cooling, which may be controlled by the growing amorphous order that emerges due to the rarefaction of metastable states in the rugged free-energy landscape. The amorphous order is well captured by point-to-set correlations, and their measurements are indispensable in testing ideas surrounding this new order parameter. To attain good statistics on point-to-set observables, however, requires a huge number of independent simulations. Exploration of many parameter ranges -- such as temperature or confinement parameters -- further increases the need for parallel computing. The high throughout computing thus provides an ideal tool for investigating the notion of the growing amorphous order in glassy systems.</Description><PIName>Patrick Charbonneau</PIName><Organization>Duke University</Organization><Department>Chemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Chemistry</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>320</ID><Name>AMS</Name><Description>Monte Carlo simulation for the AMS experiment</Description><PIName>Baosong Shan</PIName><Organization>MIT</Organization><Department>LNS</Department><FieldOfScience>Particle Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>30</ID><Name>OSG</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>301</ID><Name>AnimalSocialNetworks</Name><Description>Project Name: Animal Social Networks

Membrane-associated proteins play an essential role in controlling the bidirectional flow of material and information, and as such, they are truly devices able to accomplish complex tasks. These include ion channels, transporters, pumps, receptors, kinases, and phosphatases.
These proteins, like any machine, need to change shape and visit many conformational states to perform their function. Our project is aimed at gaining a deep mechanistic perspective of such protein function, linking structure to dynamics, by characterizing the free energy landscape that governs the key functional motions.</Description><PIName>Benoit Roux</PIName><Organization>University of Chicago</Organization><Department>Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Molecular and Structural Biosciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>28</ID><Name>BioStat</Name><Description>Bioinformatics and biostatistics for genetic risk factors at the Duke Medical Center.</Description><PIName>Janice McCarthy</PIName><Organization>Duke University</Organization><Department>Medical Center</Department><FieldOfScience>Bioinformatics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>127</ID><Name>BNL-PHENIX</Name><Description>Running HEP/NP Monte Carlo simulations for the collaboration of the PHENIX detector at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL.</Description><PIName>Matthew Snowball</PIName><Organization>Brookhaven National Laboratory</Organization><Department>Physics Department</Department><FieldOfScience>Nuclear Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>30</ID><Name>OSG</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>11</ID><Name>BNLPET</Name><Description>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at BNL: Develop the efficient and easily parallelizable 3D image reconstruction algorithms for Positron Emission Tomography detectors developed by the BNL PET group.

It is thought that most Centaurs originate from the solar system's Kuiper Belt, a reservoir of icy bodies orbiting just beyond Neptune. However, a few Centaurs with very large orbital inclinations and/or mean orbital distances cannot be well-explained with a Kuiper Belt origin. Alternatively, it has been proposed that these outlier Cenaturs may come from the Oort Cloud, a spherical halo of icy objects that extends over halfway to the nearest star. In this project we will simulate the production of Centaurs from the Oort Cloud using numerical orbital integrations. Following this, we will run our simulated orbits/objects through a sky survey simulator to compare our simulated "detections" with the real sample of known objects. Thus, we will be able to evaluate whether the Oort Cloud is a potential source of Centaurs with extreme orbits.</Description><PIName>Nathan Kaib</PIName><Organization>Northwestern University</Organization><Department>Physics and Astronomy</Department><FieldOfScience>Astrophysics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>149</ID><Name>cgdna</Name><Description>Molecular-level information of DNA at nanometer length scales is of fundamental interest to many aspects of nanotechnology and biology.

visible light spectrum into words (e.g. "red," "green," "blue" ... in English) in different ways. However, despite the apparent freedom in assigning colors to different categories, there are clear universal patterns across languages in how they divide color space according to the number of color terms in the language. This pattern has now been empirically well established, however there remains a confusion of theories for why this pattern should exist at all. In fact, a simple, evolutionary model in tandem with a model of perceptual color space and color saliency, completely accounts for the observed universal patterns. We will use the open science grid to explore the parameter space of this model via many parallel, independent runs of the dynamics to find the best fit parameter values to the language data available.</Description><PIName>Joshua B.

This project aims to demonstrate that, counter to conventional wisdom, fast-translating codons can help coordinate co-translational protein folding by minimizing misfolding [O’Brien, Nature Comm. 2014]. To do this we will use a two-step approach: First (Aim 1), we will utilize coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in combination with a genetic algorithm to find the optimal codon translation rate profile that maximizes the co-translational folding of a protein. And then (Aim 2) mutate, in silico, fast-translating codon positions to slower rates to test, if as predicted, we observe a concomitant decrease in the amount of co-translational folding. The results of this study will provide a new computational tool for the rational design of mRNA sequences to control nascent proten behavior.</Description><PIName>Edward O'Brien</PIName><Organization>The Pennsylvania State University</Organization><Department>Chemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Biophysics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>30</ID><Name>OSG</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>328</ID><Name>CpDarkMatterSimulation</Name><Description>Generate a grid of Monte Carlo samples to be used in collider-based searches for dark matter</Description><PIName>Christoph Paus</PIName><Organization>MIT</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>30</ID><Name>OSG</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>505</ID><Name>cyverse</Name><Description>CyVerse is a cyberinfrastructure project (formerly iPlant Collaborative).

These pathogens reside in the intestinal tracts of animal hosts where they encounter diverse microbial communities, fluctuating nutrient levels, and myriad host factors. Transmission between hosts requires these pathogens to survive varied environmental conditions. The general stress protection system (regulated by the alternative sigma factor, σs) is known to play a central role in environmental persistence and transmission. Acid and desiccation tolerance are two transmission-associated phenotypes that are dependent upon σs –regulated genes. We are also investigating the role of prophage in fitness. EHEC harbor multiple lambda-like prophage and cryptic phage remnants in their genome that facilitate genomic rearrangements, gene duplications, and deletions by homologous recombination. 
We are investigating how these phage-mediated genomic rearrangements influence the persistence of EHEC in its bovine host and the environment. The goals of our research are to use results from these fundamental studies in the development of strategies to reduce pathogen transmission.</Description><PIName>Chuck Kaspar</PIName><Organization>University of Wisconsin-Madison</Organization><Department>Bacteriology</Department><FieldOfScience>Microbiology</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>12</ID><Name>EIC</Name><Description>Electron Ion Collider (EIC) at BNL: Modeling the performance and optimizing the design of the prospected future Electron Ion Collider (EIC) at BNL.  https://wiki.bnl.gov/eic/index.php/Main_Page</Description><PIName>Tobias Toll</PIName><Organization>Brookhaven National Laboratory</Organization><Department>Physics Department</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>30</ID><Name>OSG</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>422</ID><Name>electrolytes</Name><Description>Molecular Dynamics simulations of concentrated electrolyte mixtures both in bulk and at interfaces, and spectroscopic characterization of these systems.

We used simulated data to quantify the effect of these data aberrations on the accuracy of population structure inference.  Data sets were simulated under the coalescent and ranged from panmictic to highly subdivided with complex, randomly generated, population histories.  Models describing the characteristic patterns of missing data and genotyping error in real microsatellite data sets were developed, and used to modify the simulated data sets.  Performance of an ordination, a tree based, and a model based Bayesian method of population structure inference was evaluated before and after data set modifications.  The ability to recover correct population clusters decreased as missing data increased.  The rate of decrease was similar among analytical procedures, thus no single analytical approach was preferable when
 faced with incomplete data.  Researchers should expect to retrieve 3–4% fewer correct clusters for every 1% of a data matrix made up of missing data using these methods.  For every 1% of a matrix that contained erroneous genotypes, approximately 1–2% fewer correct clusters were recovered using ordination and tree based methods.  A Bayesian procedure that minimizes the deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in order to assign individuals to clusters performed better as genotyping error increased.  We attribute this surprising result to the inbreeding like nature of microsatellite genotyping error, and recommend the use of related analytical methods that explicitly account for inbreeding, as a means to mitigate the effect of genotyping error.</Description><PIName>Christopher Richards</PIName><Organization>USDA Agricultural Research Service</Organization><Department>National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation</Department><FieldOfScience>Molecular and Structural Biosciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>191</ID><Name>ERVmodels</Name><Description>Project Description: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are viewed as ancient retroviral infections in vertebrate genomes and are commonly referred to as viral fossils, accounting for approximately 8% of the human genome.

Evolution simulations that explicitly model the three-dimensional interaction of mutated proteins with their targets is a new approach that complements the ongoing explosion of directed evolution experiments. In this project, the evolutionary dynamics of a lattice representation of antibiotic resistance protein (beta lactamase) is studied by enhanced-sampling folding-binding simulations for an initial protein undergoing selection-dependent mutation to bind a new antibiotic. The goals of this work are to understand the fundamental physical bottlenecks and dynamical behavior of protein evolution. Important questions include the extent of dominant pathways (convergent evolution) and phase transitions in evolutionary rates (punctuated equilibrium). These principals and their structural underpinnings can also be used to inform rational design of antibiotics that exploit bottlenecks in pathogen mutational response.</Description><PIName>Milo Lin</PIName><Organization>UT Southwestern</Organization><Department>Green Center for Systems Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Biophysics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>21</ID><Name>EvoTheory</Name><Description>Linkage disequilibrium's contribution to the maintenance of sexual reproduction

Though sexual reproduction is nearly ubiquitous in nature, its costs are substantial. Foremost among these costs are the twofold cost of males and the cost of destroying successful genetic associations. Understanding the paradox of the persistence of sex despite these detriments is a central question in evolutionary theory. In order to persist regardless of these disadvantages, the benefits of sexual reproduction must be substantial - offspring of sexual reproduction must have at least twice the fitness of asexual clones. The most generalizable hypotheses addressing the benefits of sex propose that genetic drift increases linkage disequilibrium, creating a surfeit of genomes with intermediate fitness. Sexual recombination eliminates linkage disequilibrium, thereby increasing genetic variation for fitness and improving the efficiency of natural selection. However, previous research using this framework has failed to address the biological reality of interactions between genes. Because the cost of destroying beneficial genetic interactions is one of the major costs of sex, this cannot be overlooked. In this work, I use a computational gene network model in which genes interact and genetic interactions evolve to investigate the hypothesis that linkage disequilibrium decreases the fitness and adaptability of asexual populations. I test this both by evolving artificial organisms in conditions that will increase linkage disequilibrium, and by evolving them in an environment with a shifting optimum, which will make linkage disequilibrium more costly. 

I am running a python script that runs populations of artificial gene networks (numerical matrices) through repeated rounds (on the order of 10s of thousands) of mutation, selection and reproduction, analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of these populations, and storing the data generated by this in text files.</Description><PIName>Christina Burch</PIName><Organization>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</Organization><Department>Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Evolutionary Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>66</ID><Name>ExhaustiveSearch</Name><Description>ExhaustiveSearch (or ExSearch) is a machine learning application tuned to analyze class-labeled data using n-tuple feature vectors.</Description><PIName>Sam Volchenboum</PIName><Organization>University of Chicago</Organization><Department>Computation Institute</Department><FieldOfScience>Bioinformatics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>441</ID><Name>extinction</Name><Description>Population dynamics simulations in R and Python will be used to understand how increasing environmental variability due to climate change and habitat degradation interact and affect a species' time to extinction.</Description><PIName>Shripad Tuljapurkar</PIName><Organization>Stanford University</Organization><Department>Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Ecological and Environmental Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>486</ID><Name>Fermilab</Name><Description>Project entry corresponding to Fermilab VO.</Description><PIName>Joe Boyd</PIName><Organization>Fermilab</Organization><Department>N/A</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>9</ID><Name>Fermilab</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>100</ID><Name>FFValidate</Name><Description>This project will involve running molecular dynamics simulations to validate new protein force fields.

The dynamics and static properties of glassy systems can be studied in great detail by simple model systems, either those on a lattice or those consisting of mixtures of spherical particles. In order to do that, one can use any many techniques generally under the umbrella of Monte Carlo Sampling or Molecular Dynamics. In order to get detailed properties, is is often advantageous or necessary to run a large number of independent simulations, and to calculate properties averaged over these simulations. It may also be necessary to study these systems with a range of parameter values, e.g. temperature or system size. Hence, this problem lends itself well to high throughput computing, at least for cases where the individual simulations comprising a workflow are not too long.</Description><PIName>David Reichman</PIName><Organization>Columbia University</Organization><Department>Chemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Chemistry</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>405</ID><Name>GLUEX</Name><Description>GlueX project</Description><PIName>Kurt Johann Strosahl</PIName><Organization>JLAB</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>Nuclear Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>99</ID><Name>JLab</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>490</ID><Name>gm2</Name><Description>Project entry corresponding to the gm2 VO (Muon g-2 at Fermilab).</Description><PIName>Joe Boyd</PIName><Organization>Fermilab</Organization><Department>N/A</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>9</ID><Name>Fermilab</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>481</ID><Name>GPCRbinders</Name><Description>Computational design of protein-based affinity reagents capable of binding to GPCRs and inducing an agonized or antagonize state, or binding in a function-independent manner.</Description><PIName>Christopher Bahl</PIName><Organization>Institute for Protein Innovation</Organization><Department>Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Biological Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>102</ID><Name>GRASP</Name><Description>Atomic structure calculations  based on multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock theory utilizing Grasp2k, a general-purpose relativistic atomic structure package.</Description><PIName>Richard Irving</PIName><Organization>University of Toledo</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>Physics and astronomy</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>53</ID><Name>gridsgenomes</Name><Description>The use of methylation-specific restriction enzymes to preferentially cleave 5'-CCGG-3' sites in conjunction with Next Generation Sequencing platforms has formed the basis for the widely used Methyl-seq and HELP-tagging assays.

Methods that integrate population sampling from multiple taxa into a single analysis are a much needed addition to the comparative phylogeographic toolkit. Here we present a statistical framework for multi-species analysis based on hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) for inferring community dynamics and concerted demographic response. Detecting community response to climate change is an important issue with regards to how species have and will react to past and future events. Furthermore, whether species responded individualistically or in concert is at the center of related questions about the abiotic and biotic determinants of community assembly. This method combines multi-taxon genetic datasets into a single analysis to determine the proportion of a contemporary community that historically expanded in a temporally clustered pulse as well as when the pulse occurred. We will apply this method to 59 species in the Hawaiian Archip ela! go in order to examine community response of coral reef taxa to sea-level change in Hawaii. The method can accommodate dataset heterogeneity such as variability in effective population size, mutation rates, and sample sizes across species and utilizes borrowing strength from the simultaneous analysis of multiple species. This hABC framework used in a multi-taxa demographic context can increase our understanding of the impact of historical climate change by determining what proportion of the community responded in concert or independently, and can be used with a wide variety of comparative phylogeographic datasets as biota-wide DNA barcoding data sets accumulate.</Description><PIName>Yvonne Chan</PIName><Organization>Iolani School</Organization><Department>Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Biological Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>463</ID><Name>HASHA</Name><Description>Program uses NCBI’s Entrez.efetch on the nucleotide database to take in large number of sequences and searches the sequences for palindromes ranging in size from 4 to 20 and appends the results to a list.

While everyone starts with a million-dollar idea, only a few manage to transfer into real innovations and impact our lives. What makes those ideas successful? Can you imagine an app that tells you how innovative your idea is? This project will take a computational approach to the understanding of innovation and develop a machinery to learn from real data to evaluate the creativity of new ideas.
Innovation is a broad topic, constantly discussed in business, economics, sociology, etc. It is such a complex phenomenon that there is no thorough theory about it. Here we will take a combinatorial perspective: an idea is a combination of existing and new knowledge. Hence, the goal is to understand why certain combinations are more interesting than others. Specifically, the first step is to map out our idea space with data from kickstarter, US Patents, and possibly other knowledge databases. The second step is to find interesting patterns, associations and dynamics in this map of knowledge. And finally computational methods will be developed to evaluate the fitness of any idea in a given environment.</Description><PIName>Feng Bill Shi</PIName><Organization>University of Chicago</Organization><Department>Computation Institute</Department><FieldOfScience>Statistics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>65</ID><Name>KnowledgeLab</Name><Description>Knowledge Lab / CI</Description><PIName>James Evans</PIName><Organization>University of Chicago</Organization><Department>Computation Institute</Department><FieldOfScience>Other</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>22</ID><Name>KnowledgeSys</Name><Description>In educational assessment, several questions must be answered when constructing a test, such as “How many items are necessary for adequate knowledge measurement precision?”, “How many field-test students are needed to adequately calibrate model parameters?”, or “Which computerized adaptive testing (CAT) algorithm performs best?” For complex non-linear models, these questions are typically approached by simulation: Model parameters are calibrated (as if unknown) from simulated student item responses, or the emergent properties of particular CAT algorithms are investigated with a large number of simulated test takers. Since the design space grows quickly, many simulations are necessary to understand general trends.

Match-for-OSG:

Simulations throughout the test design space can be run independently, requiring little coordination between cores. Computations generally do not have high memory requirements or unusual library/code dependencies, and computations can be recovered from checkpoints easily. The large number of simulations suggests parallel computing, but the independence allows an asynchronous, distributed environment, such as OSG.</Description><PIName>Michael J.

Through the use of computational methods, we will screen a variety of chemical scaffolds to see how well they bind to the active pocket of the KOR and Mu Opioid Receptor. From these results, we will identify targets with high binding affinity to Kappa and low binding affinity to Mu. The identified compounds will then be screened for in vitro binding affinity to identify novel KOR selective ligands.</Description><PIName>David Toth</PIName><Organization>Centre College</Organization><Department>Chemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Chemistry</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>487</ID><Name>Lariat</Name><Description>Project entry corresponding to Lariat VO.</Description><PIName>Joe Boyd</PIName><Organization>Fermilab</Organization><Department>N/A</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>9</ID><Name>Fermilab</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>477</ID><Name>LArSoft</Name><Description>The Liquid Argon Software (LArSoft) Collaboration develops and supports a shared base of physics software across Liquid Argon (LAr) Time Projection Chamber (TPC) experiments.</Description><PIName>Erica Snider</PIName><Organization>Fermilab</Organization><Department>Scientific Computing Division</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>9</ID><Name>Fermilab</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>407</ID><Name>Leaderbipartite</Name><Description>Leader-Milicevic-Tan asked how many products of complete bipartite graphs are needed to decompose the edge set of K_3 x K_n.

Thus, by analyzing a small number of genomes, we can accurately infer the demographic history of entire human populations. This demographic history helps establish a baseline that is needed for research and discovery in medical genomics. 
We are using a process to more accurately infer the demographic history of human populations by comparing genomic statistics from millions of genome simulations to real population genomic data. While other researchers have worked with this process using only a few individuals or a portion of a chromosome, we are pushing the limit of computing capabilities by simulating whole chromosomes of hundreds of individuals. Using the whole chromosome allows us to look at more recent demographic history, which is particularly helpful in finding genetic links to disease processes. After publication, we will make our pipeline available so other researchers can apply it to other populations. 
This project pushes the frontier of genomic research in that it uses new methods, simulates a larger part of the genome, and is being applied to populations not yet thoroughly studied.</Description><PIName>Ariella Gladstein</PIName><Organization>University of Arizona</Organization><Department>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Evolutionary Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>403</ID><Name>MaizeAminoAcids</Name><Description>The amino acid content in maize kernels is critically important for human and animal nutrition.

As the newly formed planets cleared debris from the young Solar System, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune tended to scatter objects inward, while Jupiter ejected these planetesimals out of the Solar System. To conserve angular momentum through this process, Jupiter slowly migrates inward while the other giant planets move outward. When Jupiter and Saturn cross a period of orbital resonance, the entire Solar System experiences a massive instability. We will run simulations to probe the affect of such an instability on an evolving system of inner planets.</Description><PIName>Nathan Kaib</PIName><Organization>University of Oklahoma</Organization><Department>Physics and Astronomy</Department><FieldOfScience>Physics and astronomy</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>398</ID><Name>Nipyperegtest</Name><Description>Regression testing of various brain imaging tools</Description><PIName>Satrajit Ghosh</PIName><Organization>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</Organization><Department>McGovern Institute for Brain Research</Department><FieldOfScience>Neuroscience</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>495</ID><Name>Nova</Name><Description>Project entry corresponding to the Nova VO.</Description><PIName>Joe Boyd</PIName><Organization>Fermilab</Organization><Department>N/A</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>9</ID><Name>Fermilab</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>30</ID><Name>NRELMatDB</Name><Description>Ab initio calculation of the physical properties of 10^4 to 10^6 materials, database of results, and web site for access.</Description><PIName>Peter Graf</PIName><Organization>NREL - National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden CO</Organization><Department>Computational Science Center</Department><FieldOfScience>Materials Science</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>416</ID><Name>nsides</Name><Description>Using deep learning models to discover statistically significant drug effects using public drug surveillance datasets from the Federal Drug Administration.</Description><PIName>Nicholas Tatonetti</PIName><Organization>Columbia University</Organization><Department>Biomedical Informatics</Department><FieldOfScience>Bioinformatics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>180</ID><Name>NSLS2ID</Name><Description>Using magnetic field measurements taken in the lab of undulators and wigglers we will compute the downstream photon spectrum and distributions for many configurations of many of the NSLS2 insertion devices, including wavefront propagation and beamline simulation where needed.</Description><PIName>Dean Andrew Hidas</PIName><Organization>Brookhaven National Laboratory</Organization><Department>National Synchrotron Light Source II</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>305</ID><Name>NSNM</Name><Description>This model uses Matlab parallel programming to predict noise sensitive neuronal model.</Description><PIName>Vadim Apalkov</PIName><Organization>Georgia State University</Organization><Department>Department of Physics and Astronomy</Department><FieldOfScience>Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>173</ID><Name>numfpi</Name><Description>We are developing a implementation of a Monte Carlo volume rendering method.

In many such circumstances, a process must overcome an energy barrier before proceeding to completion. If the size of the barrier is large compared to the available thermal energy, a process must rely on the occurrence of one or more rare events. For such circumstances, one would like to understand the reaction pathways so as to improve yields, or as in the case of protein folding, to understand the intermediate states. Many simple processes have been explored using theoretical tools such as molecular dynamics, where the movements of individual atoms are calculated. However, when the barrier is large, crossing the relevant barrier is indeed a very rare event. Although computer speeds have been doubling every 18 months (a consequence of Moore's law), the exponentially long waiting times necessary for barrier hopping pushes the required computational effort out of the feasibility range for all but the simplest models. To explore these barrier-limited processes, we are developing a novel computational technique to sample the paths themselves in a thermodynamically significant manner.</Description><PIName>Frank Pinski</PIName><Organization>University of Cincinnati</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>Computational Condensed Matter Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>364</ID><Name>PBOSD</Name><Description>Probability-based structural design has now emerged as the most advanced methodology to design new and retrofit existing structures in the face of uncertainty.

and Blackhat software for particle physics phenomenology at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and to perform studies which are directly
applicable to physics analyses in the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS.

Sherpa is a complete Monte-Carlo event generation framework
for collider experiments. Hard scattering events are simulated
using perturbative QCD at the leading or the next-to-leading
order with the help of BlackHat. QCD Resummation is implemented
by an in-house parton shower model based on the dipole factorization
approach. Hadronization is performed in a cluster model and
a complete hadron decay simulation is included in the program.

BlackHat is a program library to compute virtual corrections
in perturbative QCD based on generalized unitarity methods.
It is used to produce particle-level cross sections for
phenomenologically relevant signal and background reactions
of high particle multiplicity at the Large Hadron Collider.

Recent progress achieved with the combination of BlackHat and
Sherpa is described at

We are therefore developing a tool to assess and monitor potential carbon capture and storage sites. 

We use large-scale reservoir simulations to investigate the mechanical stresses that would effect a reservoir as it is injected with super-critical carbon dioxide. Since we will not know the precise geologic structure of a given field site, this requires us to run a very large number of computationally-intensive simulations (10$^4$-10$^7$) in order to adequately investigate every possible geologic structure. These simulations can then be compared to measurements from the surface and from wells drilled into the reservoir, allowing us to identify which proposed structures best explain the data.

The Center for Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy conducts research in four main areas:

* Improving the fidelity of models used to forecast the impact of policies on future economic and climatic conditions. Many of the most decision-relevant aspects of climate and energy policy - for example, climate impacts and technological advances - are poorly or not at all represented in current policy analysis tools. The Center will build representations of the most important processes and increase model detail and resolution.
* Quantifying sensitivities and uncertainties in the parameters, processes, and impacts in models. RDCEP will develop methods to characterize the dependence of model output on input, parameter, and model uncertainty; incorporate these uncertainties in models; and study how to communicate probabilistic model output to decision makers.
* Identifying robust decisions in the face of uncertainty. The best policy is not necessarily that which produces the maximum return if all assumptions made are borne out, but the one that balances return and risk in the face of many uncertainties. The Center will develop models to identify robust strategies that perform well over a wide range of scenarios.
* Developing improved computational methods and numerical methods required to achieve these goals. New parallel stochastic dynamic programming, robust optimal control, and numerical optimization methods able to make full use of modern supercomputers will allow tools developed at the Center to incorporate sectoral and process detail and explore uncertainty, in ways not previously possible.</Description><PIName>Ian Foster</PIName><Organization>University of Chicago</Organization><Department>Computation Institute</Department><FieldOfScience>Economics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>465</ID><Name>ReABuncherRing</Name><Description>Design of a pre-RFQ buncher ring for ReA at FRIB</Description><PIName>Phil Duxbury</PIName><Organization>Michigan State University</Organization><Department>Physics and Astronomy</Department><FieldOfScience>Physics and astronomy</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>346</ID><Name>REDTOP</Name><Description>High intensity frontier experiment searching for physics beyond the Standard Model</Description><PIName>Corrado Gatto</PIName><Organization>Fermi National Accelerator Lab</Organization><Department>Particle Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>High Energy Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>163</ID><Name>RicePhenomics</Name><Description>Analysis of salinity tolerance in rice.</Description><PIName>Harkamal Walia</PIName><Organization>University of Nebraska Lincoln</Organization><Department>Agronomy</Department><FieldOfScience>Biological Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>10</ID><Name>RIT</Name><Description>Ramsey theory studies the properties that combinatorial structures need in order to guarantee that desired substructures are contained within them.

Particle simulations produce trajectories, which are encoded by a stream of high-dimensional vectors (frames).  Analysis on this data usually takes a map-reduce form consisting of mapping each frame to successively smaller vectors of descriptors.From this starting point, two typical data analysis cases will be considered.  The first is statistical, through construction of order statistics, histograms, cumulants, or weighted averages.  We will develop code generation methods to handle general nonlinear analysis functions.  The second analysis goes one step further by fitting the analyzed data to an assumed functional form using Bayesian inference.Due to the map-reduce structure of these computations, these analysis methods can be parallelized while retaining a high-level programming model.  This task requires automated consideration of data movement and task separation to match available computational resources.  The result will be published under an open source license, and be immediately useful to computational chemistry and biology applications analyzing large molecular dynamics simulations.This work will make use of the open science grid and Pegasus software as well as the TACC Longhorn data analysis cluster for systems and application comparison.  Project code storage on XWFS and scratch access on TACC will also be needed.

A key component of simulating the IceCube detector is the correct modeling of the optical properties of the Antarctic ice which requires a lot of computation and has been adapted to run on GPUs.  

The IceProd framework is a software package developed for IceCube with the goal of managing productions across distributed systems and pooling together isolated computing resources that are scattered throughout the Collaboration. It consists of a central database hosted at University of Wisconsin-Madison and a set of daemons that are responsible for management of grid jobs as and data handling through the use of existing grid technology and network protocols. The IceCube Monte Carlo production is configured as a distributed workflow DAG that utilizes both CPU and GPU resources for various portions of the simulation chain. The intent is to utilize the Keeneland cluster in Georgia Tech to run GPU tasks and OSG for general CPU tasks through XSEDE. Intermediate files can be stored on a GridFTP server and are typically kept until the individual DAG completes.  For a large production run, a typical storage requirement might be on the order of 5 TB.

The main idea is to use three dimensional simulations to constrain the histories of observed galaxies. The majority of work (1) during the initial periods of this startup will be for Graduate Student S. Alireza Mortazavi to shift an existing Condor-based pipeline at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) to the Open Science Grid in order to test and plan for an ambitious expansion of his research program to constrain the dynamical histories of galaxies (Mortazavi et al. 2015). PI Snyder will also begin to develop pipelines to exploit large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (2), which predict the evolution of entire populations of galaxies in representative model universes, requiring data-intensive computing.  

1.  Modeling the Initial Conditions of Interacting Galaxy Pairs Using Identikit

We use the Identikit software (Barnes &amp; Hibbard 2009, Barnes 2011; http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/research/identikit/ ) to model the dynamics of interacting galaxy pairs. By measuring the initial conditions of galaxy mergers, we can constrain both cosmology and galaxy astrophysics. A galactic encounter has several free parameters and it is time consuming to find the best match between model and data. However, Identikit combines multiple techniques to quickly explore parameter space to find the simulation most similar to the observed shape and constituent velocities. We have developed an automated pipeline based on the latest version of Identikit to scan parameter space and find robust matches and associated uncertainties (Mortazavi et al. 2015), implemented in an STScI-based Condor environment. We will continue to test our method against simulations of galaxy mergers to determine the systematic errors in our measurements. In addition, we will apply it to real data: We have observed a sample of ~30 interacting galaxy pairs using different telescopes. We have reached the limits of the HTCondor cluster at STScI, and therefore we seek to test the options available through XSEDE. We need around 50,000 SUs to compute matches and uncertainties of the measurements for each merging pair (observed or simulated), and so we are requesting a startup allocation of 150,000 SUs to perform tests while planning for a larger research allocation.  This research will have direct applications for interpreting data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV survey "Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO" (MaNGA).

2.  Mock data applications from large hydrodynamical simulations

PI Snyder will develop methods for converting large cosmological simulations of galaxy formation (e.g., the Illustris Project www.illustris-project.org) into direct predictions for astronomical observatories.  With XSEDE resources, I will seek to expand our Mock Galaxy Observatory efforts in new and ambitious directions, such as creating synthetic survey fields and advanced spectroscopic data products.  For instance, we will explore the possibility of using large cosmological simulations as benchmarks for the Identikit modeling described in project 1.  For testing, we are requesting 50,000 SUs on Gordon, and Data Oasis storage of 5000GB, enough to store two Illustris Simulation (or similar) outputs plus post-processed data products.  In future allocation requests, we may seek to make these model archives available to the community through an XSEDE Gateway.</Description><PIName>Gregory Snyder</PIName><Organization>Space Telescope Science Institute</Organization><Department>Unknown</Department><FieldOfScience>Mathematical Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>165</ID><Name>TG-AST150033</Name><Description>The Kepler Mission has detected dozens of compact planetary systems with more than four transiting planets. This sample provides a collection of close-packed planetary systems with relatively little spread in the inclination angles of the inferred orbits. A large fraction of the observational sample contains limited multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity of multi-transiting systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutual inclinations, allowing them to appear as single-transiting systems in a transit-based survey. Planet formation is an active yet poorly understood field: insight to the histories and dynamics of multi-planet systems would be helpful towards understanding planet formation as a whole. 

In previous work, we have determined the regimes of parameter space for which orbital inclinations can be effectively excited by planet-planet interactions among the currently observed bodies. We found that the orbital inclination angles are not spread out appreciably through self-excitation.  In contrast, we found that the two Kepler multi-planet systems with additional non-transiting planets are susceptible to oscillations of their inclination angles, which means their currently observed configurations could be due to planet-planet interactions alone. The multi-planet compact Kepler systems are found to be remarkably stable to oscillations of their inclination angles. The oscillations of inclination found in our previous work inform the recently suggested dichotomy in the sample of solar systems observed by Kepler. However, it would also be useful to study the behaviors of these systems with perturbing companions. This would enable a better understanding of the observed systems, resulting in a more accurate exoplanet population census. To do this, we must perform computationally intensive calculations and simulations.</Description><PIName>Juliette Becker</PIName><Organization>University of Michigan</Organization><Department>Astronomy</Department><FieldOfScience>Astrophysics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>195</ID><Name>TG-AST150044</Name><Description>We are requesting 1,700,000 SUs on Open Science Grid to model the initial conditions of a sample of 15 major galaxy mergers in the local universe.

On the Sun, spots are typically small and occur in bands near the stellar equator. Sunspot occurrence frequency also peaks every 11 years due to the "solar cycle". For younger stars there are indications that spots are larger, and can form near the stellar poles, while evidence for spot activity cycles on other stars is sparse. These differences indicate that the shape and strength of the internal magnetic dynamo evolves throughout a stars life. However, because of their great distance we cannot directly observe the surface of other stars to map the locations and sizes of spots. We have developed new software to model the signature of starspots in Kepler data from transiting exoplanet systems. These star-planet systems are unique in having an orbiting planet that passes directly in front of its parent star. When the planet transits the star, it will briefly pass over spots on the star's surface, giving a very small change in the apparent brightness of the system. To trace the evolution of spot size and location with stellar age we must extend our analysis to many star systems with different transiting planet orientations. A startup allocation from XSEDE will allow us to test our software's ability to map spots from different system orientations, and using many years worth of Kepler data.</Description><PIName>James Davenport</PIName><Organization>Western Washington University</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>Astrophysics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>376</ID><Name>TG-AST160046</Name><Description>Our ultimate goal with this proposal is to understand how magnetic dynamos work on stars other than the Sun.   To do
 the science we propose which is to measure the typical starspot lifetime as a function of rotation rate and stellar mass and derive the starspot number and the spatial starspot distribution for stars other than the Sun, we must apply our light curve model
ing program to the full duration (4 years) of publicly available short cadence Kepler time series photometry of as many of our targets as possible. We must run the code many times per target in a Monte Carlo fashion in order to explore the full parameter s
pace of potential solutions. We must also do trials with different numbers of starspots in order to determine the optimal number of spots necessary to fit the light curves.   For this initial research allocation, we proposal to use the Open Science Grid to

In January 2016, astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin announced ``Planet Nine'' -- a hypothetical 10 Earth-mass object in the distant solar system responsible for the statistically significant orbital clustering of the longest-period trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Since this announcement, several more long-period TNOs have been discovered. Our specific research focus is studying the orbital dynamics of these objects, both absent of and in the presence of a Planet Nine, with the ultimate goal of determining the mostly likely orbit of a potential Planet Nine. Such a study requires numerical N-body simulations of hundreds of ``clones'' of each object, where a clone is produced by varying the orbital elements of an object within uncertainties. These simulations must encompass the entirety of the solar system's history after the formation of the planets, or approximately 4.5 billion years. Additionally, we must conduct these simulations for a suite of potential Planet Nines, further increasing the computational demand. We intend to ascertain which simulations, and therefore which configurations of Planet Nine, allow for the dynamical survival and force the orbital alignment of the longest period TNOs. The computational demand for these simulations far exceeds what is available to us on a laptop or desktop computer, and therefore we are requesting a Startup allocation on OSG to complete this work.</Description><PIName>Stephanie Hamilton</PIName><Organization>University of Michigan</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>Astrophysics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>41</ID><Name>TG-ATM130009</Name><Description>The aim of this project is to create a global map that describes the functional distributions which characterize the spectraof precipitating auroral particles. Such a map would not only aid in efforts to model the ionosphere and the geospatial environment, but would also aid in the understanding of the magnetospheric source regions of these particles. The construction of this map will utilize programs that perform automated, nonlinear least squares fits of Maxwellian and Lorentzian distributions to data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) suite of spacecraft. These programs have been developed in C under the Fedora Coredistribution and are statically linked against the HDF4 and GNU Scientific libraries. Initial testing on an AMD Athlon II X4 645quad core processor has shown that the serial execution of four separate instances of the Maxwellian automated fitting program produces fits at an average rate of 1500 spectra per hour per core, while the Lorentzian program, when executed in the same fashion, will  produce fits at an average rate of 500 spectra per hour per core. The 20-year catalog of data which we will use to populate this map contains roughly 200 million spectra. With these average rates, it would take our 16-core cluster approximately 8300 hours to fit Maxwellian distributions and 25,000 hours to fit Lorentzian distributions to the entire catalog. Given this amount of processing time and the serial nature of our programs, we wish to explore the feasability of using your HTC resources to complete this project.</Description><PIName>Phillip Anderson</PIName><Organization>University of Texas at Dallas</Organization><Department>Physics</Department><FieldOfScience>Atmospheric Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>47</ID><Name>TG-ATM130015</Name><Description>The global distribution of precipitating auroral particles is a crucial input to models of the magnetosphere and the coupling between the magnetosphere-ionosphere.

Brown Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) project is a National Science Foundation funded project operating a shared national network of civil engineering experimental facilities that seeks to develop effective ways of mitigating earthquake damage and loss of life using improved designs, materials, construction techniques, and monitoring methods. Safer buildings and civil infrastructure are needed to reduce damage and loss from earthquakes and tsunamis. Preparing for and protecting against these threats makes American communities more resilient to future disasters. To support research in the Civil Engineering community that seeks to address these problems, NEES operates 14 distributed research equipment sites across the United States. The objectives of NEES are to: develop a national and multi-user research infrastructure to enable research and innovation in earthquake and tsunami loss reduction; create an educated workforce in hazard mitigation; and conduct broader outreach and lifelong learning activities. Experimental capabilities at the 14 NEES sites include large-scale shake tables, a tsunami wave basin, large-scale testing facilities, centrifuges, field and mobile facilities, a large-scale displacement facility, and cyberinfrastructure capabilities. NEEScomm, led by Purdue University, connects the 14 NEES research equipment sites and the earthquake engineering community with a powerful information technology infrastructure and a commitment to education, outreach and training related to earthquake engineering. The center facilitates community collaboration and discovery by working to advance research based on experimentation and computational simulations of the performance of buildings, bridges, utility systems, coastal regions, and geomaterials during seismic events. In conjunction with supporting research, NEES seeks to disseminate results through education, outreach, and training to reduce the devastation and loss of human life from earthquakes and tsunamis. Through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation, the NEEScomm center is charged with leading and managing the operations of this national resource, and enabling collaboration between the 14 NEES research equipment sites and the earthquake engineering community through groundbreaking cyberinfrastructure, education and outreach efforts. NEES provides access to a variety of analysis and simulation tools for the NEES community, which includes OpenSees, OpenFresco, UI-SimCor, RDV, and Data Turbine. A groundbreaking cyberinfrastructure, the NEEShub (http://www.nees.org), connects researchers, practitioners, and the greater civil engineering community with the 14 research labs. NEEShub features the NEES Project Warehouse, which archives data gathered in all NEES experiments, along with a rich set of tools for data management, data viewing, and computational simulation. Most projects include, in addition to physical experimentation, a substantial computational component for comparison with and validation of the physical tests. As part of the Information Technology services provided to the NEES community, NEEScomm is expected to provide production quality cyberinfrastructure that is reliable and relevant to the needs of the NEES community, and to provide facilitated access to and use of campus and/or national computing resources. This proposal seeks to continue and extend the support for computational experiments in the NEES research community.</Description><PIName>Thomas</PIName><Organization>Purdue University</Organization><Department>Computer &amp; Information Technology</Department><FieldOfScience>Biological and Critical Systems</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>78</ID><Name>TG-CCR130001</Name><Description>I am applying for a renewal of campus champion allocations for Stanford.</Description><PIName>Ruth Marinshaw</PIName><Organization>Stanford University</Organization><Department>Research Computing</Department><FieldOfScience>Training</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>169</ID><Name>TG-CCR140028</Name><Description>This allocation request is as the Rutgers Campus Champion to help serve the Rutgers Academic Community better.</Description><PIName>Shantenu Jha</PIName><Organization>Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey</Organization><Department>Computer Engineering</Department><FieldOfScience>Computer and Information Science and Engineering</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>69</ID><Name>TG-CDA080011</Name><Description>Allocation needed for Campus Champion Activities</Description><PIName>Vikram Gazula</PIName><Organization>University of Kentucky</Organization><Department>Center for Computational Sciences</Department><FieldOfScience>Computer and Information Science and Engineering</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>97</ID><Name>TG-CDA100013</Name><Description>﻿﻿Campus Champion renewal to support the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</Description><PIName>Mark Reed</PIName><Organization>University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</Organization><Department>ITS Research Computing</Department><FieldOfScience>Mathematical Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>39</ID><Name>TG-CHE130091</Name><Description>Compressed carbon dioxide is the main component of the mobile phase in supercritical fluid chromatography, which separates solutes according to their interactions with solid stationary phases. Molecular-scale properties of carbon dioxide in the mobile phase, confined near a stationary phase, and interacting with solutes can be calculated by Monte Carlo molecular simulation methods. Atomistic potentials for carbon dioxide, for solutes, and for the co-solvent methanol must be tested and refined to reliably simulate interactions at the pressure-temperature conditions of supercritical fluid chromatography. Simulation code now under development is well-suited to high-throughput computing in that it is serial, portable, and requires little RAM and disk storage. Because runs are long the code will be made check-pointable so simulations can efficiently use the Open Science Grid. The startup allocation requested will be to continue development of the serial simulation code, to modify it to allow restarting from a checkpoint file, then to test and improve atomistic potentials for solute and solvent molecules. It is against bulk fluid phase equilibrium data that potentials will be refined. Should service units remain after development work, computing will shift to characterizing the solvent within a few molecular diameters of stationary-phase and solute molecules.</Description><PIName>Paul Siders</PIName><Organization>University of Minnesota, Duluth</Organization><Department>Chemistry and Biochemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Chemistry</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>51</ID><Name>TG-CHE130103</Name><Description>Energy transport in disordered systems coupled to a thermal environment is a topic that is exceedingly important for a diverse set of technological applications including organic photovoltaic solar cells, conducting polymers and a host of others. Unfortunately, at present the dynamics in these systems is not well understood. The primary difficulty is that one must accurately simulate the dynamics of relatively large open quantum systems over lengthy timescales and across a broad range of parameters. Here we request XSEDE resources to focus on two specific questions on the energy transport process that will provide both key fundamental insights, as well as useful design principles to guide the construction of more efficient materials. First, we extend the results of our previous allocation to examine the energy transport in two dimensional thin films with realistic dipolar interactions. These systems are expected to undergo a metal-insulator (Anderson) transition as a function of both the orientation of the molecular dipoles and the strength of disorder. Simulations will be performed to elucidate this phase diagram. Secondly, the nature of the transport in the weak system-bath coupling regime will be explored, wherein the dynamics are largely governed by coherent, quantum effects. The scaling properties of the transport in this regime will be determined, providing insights into the interplay of Anderson localization with the dynamics of open quantum systems.</Description><PIName>Jeremy Moix</PIName><Organization>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</Organization><Department>Chemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Chemistry</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>106</ID><Name>TG-CHE140094</Name><Description>Hybridization and denaturation transitions between DNA duplex and single stranded forms will be studied using Monte Carlo molecular simulation and a coarse-grained model.

which typically operates at temperatures and and pressures above the critical point. The
objective of the proposed work is an understanding at the molecular level of the interac-

computational method is Monte Carlo simulation, mainly in the constant-pressure Gibbs

three mobile-phase compositions. Compositions will be pure carbon dioxide and carbon
dioxide modified with 5% or 10% methanol. XSEDE resources requested are service units

The DRH specifies that deep reefs are protected from disturbances that effect shallow habitat and can provide a viable reproductive source for shallow reef areas following disturbance. It has been proposed that these foundation reefs may provide refuge not only from local disturbances such as storms or pollution, but can act as a refuge for geographically broad scale major disturbances such as the glaceoeustatic sea-level fluctuations that occur on the order of approximately 100k years at an amplitude of over 100m. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sea level was thought to have reduced shallow habitat by as much as 90% in the tropical Pacific possibly resulting in increased habitat fragmentation, local extinction, or bottlenecks. We will combine multi-taxa population genetic datasets into a single analysis to determine the proportion of the current community that historically expanded in a temporally clustered pulse, when the pulse occurred, and in what direction (i.e. from shallow water to shallow water across locations, deep water to adjacent shallow water, from shallow water to adjacent deep water, or deep water to deep water across locations.) across the Hawaiian archipelago.</Description><PIName>Robert Toonen</PIName><Organization>University of Hawaii, Manoa</Organization><Department>Unknown</Department><FieldOfScience>Biological Sciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>38</ID><Name>TG-DMR130036</Name><Description>We request high throughput computing resources to perform diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations of strongly correlated non-equilibrium electron systems.

The superfluid state of matter is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum mechanics, as it can be described by a single complex wave function with a phase that does not depend on position.  The phase coherence can be probed in a container filled with helium-4, by reducing one or more of its dimensions until they are smaller than the coherence length; the spatial distance over which order propagates.  As this dimensional reduction occurs, enhanced thermal and quantum fluctuations push the transition to the superfluid state to lower temperatures.  However, this trend can be countered via the proximity effect, where a bulk 3D superfluid is coupled to a low (2D) dimensional superfluid via a weak link producing superfluid correlations in the film at temperatures above the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. Recent experiments probing the coupling between 3D and 2D superfluid helium-4 have uncovered an anomalously large proximity effect, leading to an enhanced superfluid density that cannot be explained using the correlation length alone.We intend to explore the microscopic origin of this enhanced proximity effect via large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of helium-4 in a topologically non-trivial geometry that incorporates the important aspects of the experiments.

The numerical framework has parallel support using the MPI library, dynamic load-balancing, and parallel offline visualization. The parallel performance of the code will be tested and improved upon.

Modeling the atomic structure and underlying dynamics of these molecules is critical for understanding disease and developing therapeutics. Recent advances in experimental instrumentation and scientific software have have made high resolution biological structures more accessible than ever, but large data volumes and complex calculation often require extensive computation. Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), for example, can now reveal structures from heterogeneous biological samples to atomic resolution - better than 3 angstroms. These structures require terabytes of experimental data and upwards of 20,000 hours of compute time for accurate determinations to be made. X-ray crystallography, the workhorse of structural biology, can now combine complex computational modeling algorithms like Rosetta with experimental data to arrive at a complete structure determination, which may require more than 1000 hours of compute time. Drug discovery efforts have embraced computational “virtual screening’ to filter the most likely targets from vast drug fragment libraries by combining computational chemistry and experimentally-determined molecular structures. In these screens, the only limit to the number of drug candidates screened is computational time.  Finally, molecular dynamics simulations give insight into the motions biological molecules adopt as they perform their jobs, but also require high-performance computing resources for meaningful results.

The first aptamer to receive FDA approval was pegaptanib (Macugen), which is a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, a degenerative disease of the macula of the eye that leads to the loss of central vision. The pegaptanib aptamer acts by binding to and inhibiting the action of an isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), arresting degeneration. Functional aptamers are selected from a large, randomized initial library in a process known as SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). This is an iterative process involving numerous rounds of binding, elution, and amplification against a specific target substrate. During each iteration - or round of selection - we enrich for the species with the highest binding affinity to the target. After multiple rounds, we ideally have an enriched aptamer library suitable for subsequent investigation. Modern techniques employ massively parallel sequencing, enabling the generation of large libraries (~10^{6} sequences) in a matter of hours for each round of selection.

Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 11:2079-88) are ideal for representing motifs in their secondary structures, allowing us to discover patterns within functional aptamer populations following each round. CMs have been implemented in 'Infernal' (http://infernal.janelia.org)  a program that infers RNA alignments based on RNA sequence and structure. Calibrating a single CM in Infernal however can take several hours and is a significant performance bottleneck for our work. However, as each CM calculation is itself independently determined and requires defined pr!

 and memory resources, their computation in parallel using the Open Science Grid offers a potential solution to this problem. Using part of a Campus Champion award to our institution, we have prototyped such a solution by making use of the Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA) to interface with OSG and manage job submissions and file transfers. When run in parallel, our results showed a significant speed up, constrained by typical latencies and QoS associated with nominal OSG usage. This prior study demonstrated the feasibility of using SAGA and the OSG to support the parallelization of CM analysis of such large scale sequence based aptamer libraries, and forms the basis of this startup allocation request to further constrain workflow productivity and support the PhD research of Mr. Kevin Shieh.</Description><PIName>David Rhee</PIName><Organization>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</Organization><Department>Genetics</Department><FieldOfScience>Molecular and Structural Biosciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>137</ID><Name>TG-MCB140211</Name><Description>Why would a genotypically homogeneous population of cells live to different ages? We propose a mathematical model of cellular aging based on gene interaction network.  This model network is made of only non-aging components, and interactions among genes are inherently stochastic. Death of a cell occurs in the model when an essential gene loses all of its interactions. The key characteristic of aging, the exponential increase of mortality rate over time, can arise from this model network with non-aging components. Hence, cellular aging is an emergent property of this model network. The model predicts that the rate of aging, defined by the Gompertz coefficient, is proportional to the number of active interactions per gene and that stochastic heterogeneity is an important factor in shaping the dynamics of the aging process. Hence, the Gompertz parameter is a proxy of network robustness. Preliminary studies on how aging is influenced by power-law configuration, synthetic lethal interaction, and allelic interactions will be presented. A general framework to study network aging as a quantitative trait will be studied, and the implication on missing heritability will be investigated. Empirical results to support these theoretic studies will also be presented.

Although recent work has demonstrated the successful folding of proteins ranging from 10-80 amino acids from the unfolded state, no comparable results exist for the folding of structured RNAs. In recent work, we have shown that this is a result of underlying inaccuracies in the energy model itself, due to underlying assumptions that work well for describing amino acids but are inapplicable for describing nucleic acids in solution. We have systematically corrected these biases in order to more accurately capture the inherent flexibility of single-stranded RNA loops, accurate base stacking energetics, and purine anti-syn interconversions. In a departure from traditional quantum chemistry-centric parameterization schemes, we calibrate the molecular mechanics potentials directly against the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of aqueous nucleosides and nucleotides. This application is to continue the kinetic, thermodynamic characterization of improved RNA force-field to enable de-novo RNA folding.</Description><PIName>Alan Chen</PIName><Organization>SUNY at Albany</Organization><Department>Chemistry</Department><FieldOfScience>Molecular and Structural Biosciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>162</ID><Name>TG-MCB140268</Name><Description>The genome of many viruses is represented by a long single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA)  molecule that appears to fold into a highly compact organized structure inside the viral shell. Such structure contains a variety of topological motifs, such as hairpins, bulges, multi-loops, and notably RNA pseudoknots.  RNA pseudoknots play an important role also in natural RNAs for structural, regulatory and catalytic functions in various biological processes. In particular, it has been recently recognized an interesting interplay between the shape, structure and assembly of icosahedral viral capsids, and the compact RNA packaging topology.  The topology of RNA pseudoknots can be effectively studied by using Random Matrix Theory (RMT), by exploiting a correspondence between a graphical representation of RNA structures with pseudoknots and Feynman diagrams of a particular field theory of large random matrices. The theoretical framework of RMT provides a natural analytic tool for the prediction and classification of pseudoknots, since all Feynman diagrams can be organized in a mathematical series, called topological expansion. The PI is interested in studying numerically some recent matrix models based on RMT to describe the structure of viral RNA encapsidated in a viral icosahedral shell.  The PI has long experience in the application of RMT to the study of RNA pseudoknots with RMT, as well as on the simulation of the geometry and shapes of icosahedral shells.  
The simulations the PI intends to perform on XSEDE are Monte Carlo runs of large stochastic matrices, since the matrix model is naturally formulated as zero-dimensional SU(N) field theory  of  Hermitian matrices.  The number of matrices L is equal to number of nucleotides of the RNA molecules, which in viral RNAs can be of the order of L~10^3.  Past preliminary studies showed that the size N of the matrices should be sufficiently large to appreciate topological corrections of the order 1/N^2 and 1/N^4 (at least), which implies the simulation of Hermitian random matrices of order N~24 or N~32. Since the number of degrees of freedom for each matrix is N^2~1024, the configuration space has L*N^2~ 10^6 degrees of freedom. While matrix multiplication can benefit of parallel computing capabilities, the need of performing Monte Carlo simulations orients the PI to request High Throughput Computing resources for this initial XSEDE Startup application. Such initial experience will provide the PI a baseline to evaluate the possibility to steer future versions of the code towards HPC capabilities, including GPU or CPU-GPU clusters. Current local computational capabilities are sufficient for developing the codes and running toy-model simulations (N~4), but do not satisfy the PI’s needs for research purposes of large realistic systems. Therefore, XSEDE startup resources are requested to test larger systems, optimize the code and explore code’s scalability, as well as familiarize with the XSEDE platform.

Molecular simulations for many problems in chemistry, physics, and biology require an accurate depiction of solvation, and the most ubiquitous and important solvent is water.  Yet, water is difficult to model in molecular simulations - fast but sometimes erroneous modeling can be done with continuum solvent models, or relatively accurate but expensive modeling can be done explicitly.  Users must generally compromise accuracy and efficiency for the problem of interest.  Though widespread efforts are directed at testing water models, much of this work is duplicative and incomplete.  Here we propose extensive computer simulations of biomolecular solvation using XSEDE.  These simulations will provide a systematic database of solvation free energies for a large and diverse set of biomolecules and conformations.  This database will extend our understanding of molecular solvation and will provide a communal resource for the development of continuum solvent models, a focus of many groups throughout the field.</Description><PIName>Emiliano Brini</PIName><Organization>SUNY at Stony Brook</Organization><Department>Laufer Center</Department><FieldOfScience>Molecular and Structural Biosciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>337</ID><Name>TG-MCB160027</Name><Description>Knowledge of 3D protein structures is paramount towards our understanding of biochemistry. Currently, there are many more known protein sequences than 3D protein structures and experimentally determining their structure can be both expensive and time consuming. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to model these structures using computational methods. Our group has developed the I-TASSER method, which constructs protein structure models by iteratively assembling structure fragments obtained by multiple threading algorithms. The method was stringently tested in the community-wide CASP experiments and has been widely used by the community, including more than 65,000 registered scientists from 122 countries. Despite its success, a major obstacle in the optimization of I-TASSER involves a dearth of computational resources available for use. We have access to a computing cluster composed of 1,100 cores. However, I-TASSER has seen a surge in users on our web server, and as a result, there have been over 2,000 jobs waiting or running at any one time, far exceeding our current capacity. Therefore, an increase in computational resources for our research interests would greatly benefit the further optimization of the I-TASSER method, as well as the biological and medical community as a whole. Over the course of this allocation, we expect to run approximately 400 I-TASSER jobs; each of these jobs would take 500 CPU hours, thus we would require roughly 200,000 CPU hours total. This will be of critical importance for the improvement of the I-TASSER methods and enhance its capacity to serve for the general biological community.</Description><PIName>Yang Zhang</PIName><Organization>University of Michigan</Organization><Department>Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics</Department><FieldOfScience>Molecular and Structural Biosciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>379</ID><Name>TG-MCB160069</Name><Description>Experiments have shown that co-translational phe

High throughput methods – in particular, effective computational modeling of structure and function – are necessary to identify proteins with novel functions out of the vast number of candidate protein sequences. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods have only limited accuracy in predicting the functional impact of even a few mutations.

To improve models for functional proteins, we are developing methods within the Rosetta computational protein design software suite that represent subtle structural fluctuations using flexible-backbone ensembles and integrate multiple functional constraints on proteins (i.e. catalytic conformations or binding partners). Promising initial results demonstrated improvement over standard fixed-backbone approaches in initial tests against large curated mutational datasets for experimentally determined binding affinities and high-throughput screening of protein-protein interactions. 

Our approach of using discrete ensembles to model flexible and dynamic systems is well suited to the distributed nature of high performance computing clusters. Our goal of predicting the functional effect of defined sequences is likewise well suited. In particular, the Open Science Grid will be very useful for our high-processing, low-memory requirements. The purpose of this Startup request is two-fold: benchmarking and optimizing computational methodologies to model functional proteins. First, we will streamline our methodology for XSEDE in preparation for a Research allocation application. Second, additional computing resources from XSEDE will greatly expand our ability develop methodology beyond the limitations of benchmarking on the computational resources at our home institution.</Description><PIName>Samuel Thompson</PIName><Organization>University of California, San Francisco</Organization><Department>Bioengineering and Therapeutics</Department><FieldOfScience>Molecular and Structural Biosciences</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>35</ID><Name>TG-OCE130029</Name><Description>Methods that integrate population sampling from multiple taxa into a single analysis are a much needed addition to the comparative phylogeographic toolkit.

The excitement of this finding was felt world-wide and is a breakthrough in our understanding of the Universe at a fundamental level.   Saying therefore that we now live in a post-Higgs era in high energy physics is no exaggeration. This breakthrough by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is just a first step towards testing much extensive theories such as supersymmetry and grand unification. Computing tools played an important role in the discovery of the Higgs and the need for these tools to explore ideas beyond the Standard Model is ever increasing. Resources like XSEDE therefore provide an opportunity to use cutting edge computing tools in order to explore novel ideas in high energy physics. Our startup allocation of 150,000 SU's resulted in four peer reviewed publications. With the second allocation of 3 million SUs our group managed to  complete 10 articles out of which 7 have been published in peer reviewed journals and three are in process. The data for two other projects have been collected. These projects resulted from the consumption of only 32% of the total SUs that were allocated. Our consumption of the SUs was much less than anticipated since we have improved the computing techniques we use in our projects. We are therefore requesting an extension of our current SUs since a surplus of SUs is always useful for us to pursue projects even if the SU requirement is high.</Description><PIName>Qaisar Shafi</PIName><Organization>University of Delaware</Organization><Department>Physics and astronomy</Department><FieldOfScience>Physics and astronomy</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>310</ID><Name>TG-PHY150040</Name><Description>IceCube is a neutrino detector built at the South Pole by instrumenting about a cubic kilometer of ice with 5160 light sensors.

However, fulfilling such roles is increasingly dependent on the ability to handle very large spatial datasets and complex analysis and modeling methods based on synthesizing computational and spatial thinking enabled by cyberinfrastructure (CI), which conventional GIS software approaches do not provide. CI-based integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis and modeling, as a holistic solution, is leading to unprecedented capabilities for transforming geospatial sciences.The purpose of this project is to extend and sustain GISolve, a TeraGrid Science Gateway toolkit for GIScience, for establishing a high performance, distributed, and collaborative CyberGIS framework that couples CI, GIS, and geospatial analysis and modeling capabilities. Through the continuous TeraGrid resource allocation support from previous three years, a set of spatial middleware components has been built into the GISolve Toolkit to glue generic cyberinfrastructure capabilities and geospatial analysis methods. This toolkit has been used to build the TeraGrid GIScience Gateway as a collaborative geospatial problem-solving environment for multi-disciplinary researchers to perform large-scale geospatial analysis and modeling, and help non-technical users directly benefit from accessing TeraGrid capabilities. With the support of TeraGrid high-end computing resources, we have developed a set of high-performance parallel and distributed geospatial computational methods for our research projects. Scalability and efficient use of high-end computing resources are the foci in developing these methods. For example, the parallel agent-based modeling and parallel land use optimization code are scalable to thousands of processors on Abe and Ranger with impressive computational performance. The methods so developed have been applied in solving large- and multi-scale geospatial science problems that could not be solved before, such as the study of geospatial pattern of the impact of global climate change on crop yields. With GISolve being widely used in the GIScience community, new methods continue to be identified, proposed, and integrated in the GISolve Toolkit. To support community-contributed applications, we have developed a streamlined application integration process to facilitate cyberinfrastructure-enabled computation and efficient integration into the science gateway for sharing. This project has been growing dramatically with consistent and extended research collaboration and education efforts such as the collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the National Map project and outreach activities with the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS).</Description><PIName>Shaowen Wang</PIName><Organization>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</Organization><Department>Geography and Geographic Information Science</Department><FieldOfScience>Geographic Information Science</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>113</ID><Name>TG-STA110011S</Name><Description>renewing project</Description><PIName>Stephen McNally</PIName><Organization>University of Tennessee, Knoxville</Organization><Department>NICS</Department><FieldOfScience>Other</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>48</ID><Name>TG-STA110014S</Name><Description>Staff Account for Training</Description><PIName>Nancy Wilkins-Diehr</PIName><Organization>University of California-San Diego</Organization><Department>San Diego Supercomputer Center</Department><FieldOfScience>Training</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>45</ID><Name>TG-TRA100004</Name><Description>Swarthmore College Campus Champion Renewal</Description><PIName>Andrew Ruether</PIName><Organization>Swarthmore College</Organization><Department>ITS</Department><FieldOfScience>Training</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>13</ID><Name>OSG-XSEDE</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>111</ID><Name>TG-TRA110013</Name><Description>Description: Campus Champions for Case Western Reserve University, helping faculty to start onboarding XSEDE resources.

The CPASS database and software enable the comparison of experimentally identified ligand binding sites to infer biological function and aid in drug discovery. The CPASS database is comprised of unique ligand-defined active sites identified in the Protein Data Bank, and the CPASS program compares these ligand-defined active sites to determine sequence and structural similarity without maintaining sequence connectivity, along with ligand similarity, if desired. CPASS will compare any set of ligand-defined protein active sites irrespective of the identity of the bound ligand.</Description><PIName>Adam Caprez</PIName><Organization>University of Nebraska - Lincoln</Organization><Department>Bioinformatics</Department><FieldOfScience>Bioinformatics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>67</ID><Name>HCC</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>467</ID><Name>UPCDOSAR</Name><Description>Researchers from UNAL will be using OSG and running example jobs on Monte Carlo simulations, they will be submitting jobs related to bit patterned media, following this work http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386947715303222, and will also be submitting jobs related to research in critical phenomena, similar to what was done here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304885316324933?via%3Dihub and here http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304885316320169?via%3Dihub</Description><PIName>Rob Quick</PIName><Organization>Indiana University</Organization><Department>Research Technologies</Department><FieldOfScience>Computational Condensed Matter Physics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>42</ID><Name>UPRRP-MR</Name><Description>In this collaborative project between bioinformatics and physics we use molecular evolution simulations to evolve a population of proteins. We look for the emergence of mutational robustness of proteins in the population. This quantity measures how resistant they are to the deleterious effects of mutations. Previous results from Dr. Massey's group suggest that mutational robustness increases and eventually converges over time. This appears to be an emergent property of proteins. It has profound evolutionary implications. 

The protein structures are obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Non-robust sequences are threaded onto the structure and are subjected to random mutations. The resulting sequences are selected for their free energy of folding. Once the sequences are generated the mutational robustness is calculated in parallel (through Condor).</Description><PIName>Steven Massey</PIName><Organization>Universidad de Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus (UPRRP)</Organization><Department>Physics / Biology</Department><FieldOfScience>Bioinformatics</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><VirtualOrganization><ID>30</ID><Name>OSG</Name></VirtualOrganization></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>96</ID><Name>UserSchool2014</Name><Description>Training project for OSG User School 2014.</Description><PIName>Tim Cartwright</PIName><Organization>OSG</Organization><Department>OSG</Department><FieldOfScience>Multi-Science Community</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>170</ID><Name>UserSchool2015</Name><Description>User School 2015 at University of Wisconsin - Madison</Description><PIName>Tim Cartwright</PIName><Organization>University of Wisconsin - Madison</Organization><Department>Computer Science</Department><FieldOfScience>Education</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>345</ID><Name>UserSchool2016</Name><Description>Training project for OSG User School 2016</Description><PIName>Tim Cartwright</PIName><Organization>University of Wisconsin Madison</Organization><Department>Computer Science</Department><FieldOfScience>Education</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>425</ID><Name>UserSchool2017</Name><Description>Training project for OSG User School 2017</Description><PIName>Tim Cartwright</PIName><Organization>University of Wisconsin Madison</Organization><Department>Computer Science</Department><FieldOfScience>Multi-Science Community</FieldOfScience><Sponsor><CampusGrid><ID>14</ID><Name>OSG Connect</Name></CampusGrid></Sponsor></Project><Project><ID>107</ID><Name>velev</Name><Description>Electronic structure of solids.
