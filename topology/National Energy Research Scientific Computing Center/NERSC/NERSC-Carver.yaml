    Description: |-
      Carver, named in honor of American scientist George Washington Carver, is an IBM iDataPlex system with 400 compute nodes. Each node contains two Intel Nehalem quad-core processors (3,200 cores total). The system's theoretical peak performance is 34 Tflop/s.
      This is intended for MPI jobs and as an entry point to the NERSC Magellan cloud system.
