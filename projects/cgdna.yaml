- Description: Molecular-level information of DNA at nanometer length scales is of
    fundamental interest to many aspects of nanotechnology and biology. Molecular
    models provide a powerful tool to interrogate these systems by providing detailed
    thermodynamic and kinetic information. Towards this end, this project involves
    developing highly-accurate coarse-grained models of DNA and using them to study
    complex nano-scale phenomena.
