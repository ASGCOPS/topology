- Description: Equilibrium dynamical models are useful tools for inferring the mass
    distribution of galaxies and determining the amount and structure of their dark
    matter halos. The goal of this work is to explore degeneracies in the modeling
    of elliptical galaxies to evaluate how well we can understand properties such
    as their dark matter density distribution, the mass-to-light ratio of their stellar
    populations, and the orbital anisotropy of various tracer populations.
