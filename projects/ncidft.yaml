- Description: 'Project Description: Density-Functional Theory (DFT) is the most successful
    method for the computation of quantum mechanical properties in molecules and solids.
    The aim of our project is to advance the DFT field by extending and improving
    the existing methods for modeling non-covalent interactions. Computational tasks
    for this project include DFT calculations on small molecules as well as periodic
    solids, and the use of home-made programs that implement our methodologies.'
