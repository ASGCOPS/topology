- Description: This project will make use of fMRI data of psychotic patients in order
    to parse heterogeneity in functional activity across multiple diagnosis. The need
    for computing power results from the need to preprocess the fMRI, from which we
    want to obtain a region level connectivity matrix for each of the approximately
    1200 subjects that will be analyzed.
