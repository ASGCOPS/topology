- Description: "The main goal of the project is to design a computational framework\
    \ that enables computational experimentation at scale while supporting the model\
    \ of \u201Csubmit locally, compute globally\u201D. The project focuses on estimating\
    \ application resource needs, finding the appropriate computing resources, acquiring\
    \ those resources, deploying the applications and data on the resources, managing\
    \ applications and resources during run. The project also aims to advance the\
    \ understanding of resource management within a collaboration in the areas of:\
    \ trust, planning for resource provisioning, and workload, computer, data, and\
    \ network resource management."
