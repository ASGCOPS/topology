- Description: This project will use the OSG to demonstrate the feasibility of using
    a new steady state genetic algorithm (SSGA), recently introduced by the MGAC collaboration,
    to predict the crystal structures of molecules of pharmaceutical interest. The
    OSG resources are ideal for this project because the SSGA requires a large number
    of independent energy calculations of candidate structures. These calculations
    for simple molecules will use the DFT approach, using software already available
    in the OSG.
