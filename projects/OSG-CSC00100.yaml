- Description: Develop a metric that measures the real similarities and differences
    between machine learning algorithms (in this case classifiers) based on output
    behavior.  Previous study included 17 representative algorithms and used 30 datasets
    from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The main goal of the current effort
    is to extend the metric using semi-supervised learning techniques. I would also
    like, if possible, to experiment with more recent datasets beyond what is traditional
    from the UCI Repository; and to add more algorithms to the study.
