- Name: selfassembly
- Description: The influence of directing agents in the self-assembly of molecular
    wires to produce two-dimensional electronic nanoarchitectures is studied here
    using a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the effect of arbitrarily locating nodal
    points on a surface, from which the growth of self-assembled molecular wires can
    be nucleated.
