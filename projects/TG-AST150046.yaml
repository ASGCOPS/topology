- Description: We are using several large codes to search the photometric database
    from the Kepler satellite for stars that exhibit flares and starspots, to characterize
    the flare and starspot behavior and to extract information on starspot locations
    and properties using transiting planets as probes of stellar surface brightness
    variations.  The XSEDE resources will enable this project to proceed much more
    quickly than with the resources at our home institutions.
