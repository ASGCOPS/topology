- Description: Graph theory analyses would be investigated on weighted undirected
    matrices based on the probability of white matter connectivity between 26 regions
    comprising both cortical and subcortical structures on children with epilepsy
    with and without anxiety disorders. This project aims at investigating if there
    are fundamental differences in structural connectivity in children with idiopathic
    epilepsy with and without anxiety comorbidity. The neuropsychological implications
    of potential differences between groups would also be investigated.
