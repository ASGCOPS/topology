- Description: Glass problem is one of the outstanding unsolved problems in condensed
    matter physics. The exact solution of a model glass former in the limit of infinite
    spatial dimension exhibit a dynamical critical point. It is important to check
    the robustness of the resulting description under changing d for fundamental understanding.
    In this project we aim to take a closer look at this dynamical criticality as
    a function of spatial dimensions, using models of polydisperse hard sphere fluids.
    Computer simulation is an essential tool to pursue this study.
