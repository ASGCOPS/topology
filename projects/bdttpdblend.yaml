- Description: We will utilize the Open Science Grid to conduct quantum chemical calculations
    and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of organic photovoltaic morphologies. We have
    a simulation pipeline that enables high throughput material screening for chemistires
    and processing conditions relevent for organic photovoltaic devices. We will use
    molecular configurations from previously simulated morphologies, generated with
    molecular dynamics code accelerated by GPUs.
