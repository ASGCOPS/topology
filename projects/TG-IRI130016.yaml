- Description: Analysis of geospatial imagery has become a promising approach for
    characterizing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) proliferation. The goal of this
    project is to design algorithms and computer executable that can extract man-made
    objects (e.g., building, road, gate, etc.) from high-resolution images (recording
    the boundary and location, and possible type).
