- Description: To develop a contextual search technique on a given text corpus. The
    idea is to develop a search model using Deep Learning techniques and Natural Language
    Processing. More specifically, we are currently exploring Word Embedding techniques
    in NLP and Neural Network models like Word2Vec. The model would first train itself
    on the existing email corpus of a given user and then be able to provide search
    results based on contextual queries.
