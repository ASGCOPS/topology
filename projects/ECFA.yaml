- Description: |-
    Simulate hundreds of millions of high-energy
    proton proton collisions, which mimic the
    collisions expected at the LHC in the coming
    years.  This simulated data is used to assess the
    physics potential of potential detector upgrades,
    allowing decision makers and funding agencies to
    plan for the future.
