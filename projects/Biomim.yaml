- Description: The project involves studies of substrate binding, electron and proton
    transport pathways and substrate release in enzymes that can catalyze the synthesis
    of fuels in photoelectrochemical cells. The insights obtained will guide the design
    of small molecule electrocatalysts in collaboration with experimentalists.
