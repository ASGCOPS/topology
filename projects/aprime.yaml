    DarkLight experiment planned to run at Jefferson LAB in the upcoming years will search for a massive photon possibly produced in interaction of an electron with electric filed of a proton.

    Monte-Carlo simulations are needed design and optimize the Darklight experiment. The initial OSG-Connect resources of few CPU years will be sufficient. The simulation will use CERN libraries, namely: Geant4.10, root5.34, compiled on Scientific Linux 6.5.
