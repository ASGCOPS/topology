- Description: Different languages divide the visible light spectrum into words (e.g.
    "red," "green," "blue" ... in English) in different ways. However, despite the
    apparent freedom in assigning colors to different categories, there are clear
    universal patterns across languages in how they divide color space according to
    the number of color terms in the language. This pattern has now been empirically
    well established, however there remains a confusion of theories for why this pattern
    should exist at all. In fact, a simple, evolutionary model in tandem with a model
    of perceptual color space and color saliency, completely accounts for the observed
    universal patterns. We will use the open science grid to explore the parameter
    space of this model via many parallel, independent runs of the dynamics to find
    the best fit parameter values to the language data available.
