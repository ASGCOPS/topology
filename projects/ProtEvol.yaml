- Description: How large a role does history play in evolution? Do later events depend
    critically on specific earlier events, or do all events occur more or less independently?
    If a change occurs early in evolution, does it become easier or harder to revert
    the change as time proceeds? We intend to explore these ideas in the context of
    protein evolution, by simulating sequence evolution under purifying selection
    and then systematically permuting the order of amino-acid substitutions.
