- Description: |-
    We are developing a implementation of a Monte Carlo volume rendering method. The primary purpose is to impro
    ve the calculation of multiple scattering physics, with possible applications in computer graphics, nuclear physics, and remote s
    ensing. The project involves the numerical calculation of a Feynman path integral, which is what most of the computation is devot
    ed to, and the primary need for high throughput computing methods.
