- Description: CometCloud is an autonomic framework for enabling real-world applications
    on dynamically federated, hybrid infrastructure integrating (public & private)
    clouds, data-centers and Grids. Specifically, CometCloud provides abstractions
    and mechanisms to support a range of programming paradigms and real-world applications
    on such an infrastructure. Furthermore, it enables policy-based autonomic cloud-bridging
    and cloud-bursting. Autonomic cloud-bridging enables on-the-fly integration of
    local computational environments (data-centers, grids) and public cloud services
    (such as Amazon EC2), and autonomic cloud-bursting enables dynamic application
    scale-out to address dynamic workloads, spikes in demands, and other extreme requirements.
    Currently, we support various applications as part of our collaborations in multiple
    domains such as medical diagnostics, material sciences, biology, and engineering.
