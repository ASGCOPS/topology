- Description: A degree sequence of a hypergraph is a list of numbers that gives the
    total number of edges each vertex is in and multiple hypergraphs can have the
    same degree sequence.  I'm trying to determine a minimal set of moves that connects
    all of the realizations.  I need to use parallel programming as there are many
    degree sequences to investigate.
