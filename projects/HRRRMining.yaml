- Description: I have archived about 30TB (and growing) of output from NOAA's operational
    High Resolution Rapid Refresh model on an object storage archive system at Utah's
    Center for High Performance Computing. The challenge is to mine data from such
    a large data set. Open Science Grid may be a solution for processing this voluminous
    data set, if questions and data mining objectives can be broken into serial tasks.
