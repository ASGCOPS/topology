- Name: NSLS2ID
- Description: Using magnetic field measurements taken in the lab of undulators and
    wigglers we will compute the downstream photon spectrum and distributions for
    many configurations of many of the NSLS2 insertion devices, including wavefront
    propagation and beamline simulation where needed.
