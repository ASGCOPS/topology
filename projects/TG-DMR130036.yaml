- Description: 'We request high throughput computing resources to perform diagrammatic
    Monte Carlo calculations of strongly correlated non-equilibrium electron systems.
    The calculations employ existing implementations of real-time quantum Monte Carlo
    algorithms for the solution of quantum impurity models, which have been tested
    and benchmarked; they also involve extensions to these algorithms which are currently
    under development. We will use these codes to address two types of physics problems:
    strongly correlated lattice systems treated within the dynamical mean field approximation,
    and exact properties of model systems for mesoscopic and molecular electronic
    junctions.'
