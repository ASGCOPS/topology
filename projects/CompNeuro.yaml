    To give you a brief idea, I am trying to identify the information flow
    among several brain regions in rats in the neuronal level. The rats
    were actively doing a aperture discrimination task (whether a gate
    opened wide or narrow).  I wish to find not only the static neuronal
    circuitry of the sensory input, but also the dynamics of the flow
    across time.
