- Description: |-
    Simulate hundreds of millions of high-energy
    proton proton collisions, which mimic the
    collisions expected at future hadron colliders.
    This simulated data is used to assess the physics
    potential of future colliders, allowing US
    decision makers and funding agencies to prioritize
    future physics projects.
