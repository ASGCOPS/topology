- Name: POLARBEAR
- Description: The evolution of the universe is based on the idea of gravitational
    instability, whereby initial tiny fluctuations in the density of the Universe
    grew under the influence of gravity to form the large-scale gravitational structures
    we see around us today. These structures bend the trajectories of Cosmic Microwave
    Background photons through gravitational lensing, distorting its primordial polarization
    and converting divergent polarization patterns (E-modes) into curled polarization
    patterns (B-Modes). Imaging the lensing-generated B-modes, the POLARBEAR telescope
    will be able to shed light on all the components of the Universe influencing structure
    formation, such as neutrino mass and dark energy.
