- Description: The project looks into the use of heteroskedasticity consistent variance-covariance
    estimators for conducting hypothesis testing. It uses Monte Carlo and bootstrap
    techniques to find the distribution of t-statistics using heteroskedasticity consistent
    variance-covariance estimator under normality and nonnormality. Comparison between
    using different heteroskedasticity consistent estimators are included and possible
    corrections are proposed and will be examined.
