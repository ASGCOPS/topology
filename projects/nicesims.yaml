- Description: The Nice Model, is an evolutionary model for the outer Solar System
    which has explained many puzzling observed qualities of the Solar System. As the
    newly formed planets cleared debris from the young Solar System, Saturn, Uranus,
    and Neptune tended to scatter objects inward, while Jupiter ejected these planetesimals
    out of the Solar System. To conserve angular momentum through this process, Jupiter
    slowly migrates inward while the other giant planets move outward. When Jupiter
    and Saturn cross a period of orbital resonance, the entire Solar System experiences
    a massive instability. We will run simulations to probe the affect of such an
    instability on an evolving system of inner planets.
