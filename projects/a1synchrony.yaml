- Name: a1synchrony
- Description: We investigate how synchronous population activity arise in spiking
    dynamics of the sensory and other cortical areas. We especially focus on how primary
    auditory cortex modulate dynamical timescales during spontaneous bump dynamics
    in quiet wake condition and up and down states in anesthetized and sleep conditions.
