- Name: Phylogenomics
- Description: The project entails the sequencing and assembly of the transcriptomes
    of 100+ non-model tree species from the USA and China. This information is then
    used to infer a functional phylogenomic tree from which inferences regarding functional
    similarity and species co-existence and diversity are drawn.
