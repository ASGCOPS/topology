- Name: MaizeAminoAcids
- Description: The amino acid content in maize kernels is critically important for
    human and animal nutrition. However, the genetic basis underpinning amino acids
    is not fully understood. We are performing Genome Wide Association Studies and
    Genomic prediction in a panel of several thousand maize plants genotyped at tens
    of millions of loci to finely dissect amino acid traits in maize.
