- Description: We are condensed-matter theorists at Duke. We study the onset of strong
    correlation in various setups, such as qubits coupled to a 1D waveguide and impurities
    immersed in an electromagnetic environment. With the aid of the OSG distributive
    environment, we are able to solve problems using a variety of numerical approaches,
    including but not limited to quantum Monte Carlo, quantum jumps, etc.
