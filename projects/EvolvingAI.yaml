- Description: Modern day software and robotics are notorious for lacking robustness
    and adaptability, often breaking down when encountering unexpected situations.
    Natural animals, on the other hand, are well known for their robustness and their
    ability to adapt to new environments. The Evolving Artificial Intelligence project
    aims to study how the robustness and adaptability of natural animals evolved,
    both to learn more about natural evolution, and to increase the robustness and
    adaptability of modern software and robotics systems.
