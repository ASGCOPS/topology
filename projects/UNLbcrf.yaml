- Description: The Bioinformatics Core Research Facility at UNL runs several large
    scale compute projects a year. Our main compute is focused on sequence analysis,
    de-novo assembly and gene prediction/annotation, secondary structure prediction,
    peptide-protein docking, and phenotype image analysis. We tend to run projects
    that deal with species critical for agriculture, both crops and livestock, but
    also with human-virus or food-gut microbiome interactions.
