- Description: Simulate hundreds of millions of high-energy proton proton collisions,
    which mimic the collisions expected at a potential High Luminosity LHC.  This
    simulated data will be used to assess the performance of potential CMS detector
    upgrades, for inclusion in a Technical Proposal.
